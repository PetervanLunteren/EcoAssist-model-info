The following species or aggregated classes are represented in the dataset: Tasmanian Pademelon (Thylogale billardierii), Bennetts Wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus), Tasmanian Devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), Feral Cat (Felis catus), Bare-nosed Wombat (Vombatus ursinus), Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), Fallow Deer (Dama dama), Southern Brown Bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), Currawong (Black: Strepera fuliginosa, Grey: S. versicolor) and Bronzewing (Brush: Phaps elegans, Common: P. chalcoptera). The latter two classes are birds, each of which consist of an aggregation of two species within a genus; the former eight are mammals. ",
